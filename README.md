## Additional notes

For running this, I set up a Python 3.12 venv, with the assumption
that the project would be run in Neovim. To run a single day's code
after activating the venv, use:

```sh
source bin/activate # Activation, only needs to be done once per shell environment
```

To run:
```
python3 day<1...25> "day<1...25>/<example_input1.txt|input1.txt>" [2]
```
