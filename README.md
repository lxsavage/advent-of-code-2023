## Additional notes

For running this, I set up a Python 3.12 venv. To run a single day's code after
activating the venv, use:

```sh
# Activation, only needs to be done once per shell environment
source bin/activate
```

To run:
```
python3 day<1...25> "day<1...25>/<example_input1.txt|input1.txt>" [2]
```
